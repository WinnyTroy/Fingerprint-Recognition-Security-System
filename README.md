# Fingerprint-Recognition-Security-System  

The  main  technologies  used  to  capture  the  fingerprint  image with sufficient detail are optical, silicon, and ultrasound. There are two main algorithm families to recognize fingerprints: 

1.  Minutia   matching   compares   specific   details   within   the fingerprint  ridges.  At  registration  (also  called  enrollment),  the minutia   points   are   located,   together   with   their   relative positions  to  each  other  and  their  directions.  At  the  matching stage,  the fingerprint image is processed to extract  its  minutia points, which are then compared with the registered template. 

2.Pattern  matching  compares  the  overall  characteristics  of  the fingerprints,     not     only     individual     points.     Fingerprint characteristics   can   include   sub-areas   of   certain   interest including   ridge   thickness,   curvature,   or   density.   During enrollment,  small  sections  of  the  fingerprint  and  their  relative distances  are  extracted  from  the  fingerprint.  Areas  of  interest are  the  area  around  a  minutia  point,  areas  with  low  curvature radius, and areas with unusual combinations of ridges.

The two main functions of a biometrics system are storing and comparing.   The   storing   process   differs   between   different systems, as some  systems  store  a  great deal  more  information and will digitize and compress the information. 

Once the print information is stored in an accessible database, a  user's  prints  can  be  compared  whenever  the   system  is accessed.  You  are  authenticated  when  both  the  stored  and user's  print  match.  Finger  print  readers  use  this  uniqueness  to generate  a  code   

-rarely  do  they  actually  use  the  full  print  for identification 

-based  on areas  where  print  lines  merge,  form, or loop like  the round "whirl" that  you can  find in the  middle 

of all finger prints.
